## Full Post

Hey Reddit! 👋

I just finished building **BrainRot Generator** - a complete pipeline for creating those viral dialogue videos you see everywhere.

### What it does:
- 🎙️ **AI Voice Generation**: Paste any dialogue script, assign ElevenLabs voices to speakers
- 🖼️ **Chrome Extension**: Drag-to-select images from ANY webpage (no manual downloads!)
- 🎥 **Auto Video Creation**: Combines voices, images, background video, and animated captions
- 📱 **Instagram Upload**: Direct upload to your Instagram account

### The Chrome Extension is the coolest part:
Instead of manually downloading images, you can:
1. Parse your script in the web app
2. Open the extension side panel
3. Browse to any website
4. Drag to select screen areas for each dialogue line
5. Images sync in real-time back to the app!

It handles device pixel ratios, viewport scaling, and works on all websites. The selection box is transparent so you get clean captures.

### Tech Stack:
- FastAPI + Python backend
- ElevenLabs for AI voices
- MoviePy for video processing
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) with side panel UI
- Instagram Graph API integration

### Try it out:

Would love feedback from the community! What features would you add?
